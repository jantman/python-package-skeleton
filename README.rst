Skeleton for a python package, complete with tox/Travis-CI, Landscape.io, codecov, etc.

Usage
------

Run:

    /path/to/python-package-skeleton/use_skeleton.sh <project name>

This will create a ``project name`` directory under your pwd and populate it with the skeleton.

You'll then need to make some updates in many of the files, but it's a good starting point.
    
Actions
--------

See ``use_skeleton.sh``, it's simple enough.
