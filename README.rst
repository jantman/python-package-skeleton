Skeleton for a python package, complete with tox/Travis-CI, Landscape.io, codecov, etc.

Usage
------

From the directory you want to setup your new package in, run:

    /path/to/python-package-skeleton/use_skeleton.sh <project name>

You'll then need to make some updates in ``.travis.yml`` and ``setup.py``.
    
Actions
--------

See ``use_skeleton.sh``, it's simple enough.
